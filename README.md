# Welcome to the Bonsai Backend Test!

# Getting Started

The easiest way to start this application locally is by running its Docker containers with the [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) tool.

Notice that `docker-compose` requires the **Docker Engine** in order to work. To install **Docker**, check [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/#server).

With `docker-compose`, all you need to do is update the `OMDB_API_KEY` in the `docker-compose.yml` file and run the following command on the root project directory:
```
docker-compose up
```

And voil√†! The **server** application will be available on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). You can also access MongoDB at port 27020.

### OMDB_API_KEY
Don't forget the OMDB_API_KEY environment variable! Otherwise, you won't be able to fetch OMDb movie data.

## Alternatives for running locally

You can also start the project with the `npm start` or `npm run watch` command. Notice that, by doing this, you will need to set up the database on your own. By default, this server application uses the following environment variables:

```
MONGO_HOST=localhost
MONGO_PORT=27017
MONGO_DB=bonsai-backend-test
PORT=4000 # Application port
```

## Data initialization
To initialize `Ticket` and `Movie` data, it is needed to subscribe to `initializeTickets`. It will fetch Tickets from the Bonsai API and persist it in batches. As soon as it is persisted, the data will be published to GraphQL, and you will received it from the subscription. After the Ticket initialization is done, the application will automatically start fetching data from the OMDb API to populate the `Movie` data. `Movie` content can be accessed from a `Ticket`.

## GraphQL operations

### Queries
ticket: Fetches a single Ticket by its ID
listTickets: Fetches a list of Tickets with pagination. Pagination can be controlled by setting the 'after' parameter with the cursor. To navigate to the next page, set 'after' with the cursor of the latest node from the current query.

### Mutations
addTicket: Persists a new single Ticket

### Subscriptions
initializeTickets: Initialize Tickets by fetching data from the Bonsai endpoint, and publishes Tickets batches as soon as they are persisted on the database.

## Old README.md content

We want to test your skills in a few key areas, especially with respect to how you think about problems and the values you bring to the code you write. Take your time, we want to see your best work.

We've prepared a basic skeleton of a project to help you work a little bit faster. Feel free to change out anything in the project as long as you meet the `Requirements`. Just because something is written doesn't mean it is right!

## Requirements

- [x] Provide a GraphQL endpoint to initiate cleaning and storing of ticket data into MongoDB from the provided external API
  - API: `https://us-central1-bonsai-interview-endpoints.cloudfunctions.net/movieTickets?skip=0&limit=10`
  - The `skip` and `limit` parameters are the only ones that exist.
  - There are only `1000` movie tickets in this test feed but you should be able to consume more than that
- [x] Clean and store additional data about the imported movie tickets from this API: http://www.omdbapi.com/
- [x] Create a GraphQL endpoint that can deliver data from both data sources
  - Support pagination
- [x] Sufficiently and effectively unit test functions as you see fit
- [x] Fix any bugs or bad code you happen to find along the way
- [x] Optimize one previously written function (`(method) TicketResolver.listTickets(input: ListTicketsInput): Promise<Ticket[]>` in `source/resolvers/Ticket.resolver.ts`). It should get resolved in under 15ms when fetching for 10 items out of 1000+ documents

## Evaluation

Please document your changes well and make as many atomic commits as you feel are necessary for someone to see how you work.

We will be evaluating the following:

- How well and completely you meet the requirements
- Attention to detail
- Following modern best practices
- Robustness of testing, both manual and automatic
- Communication clarity in code, documentation and pull request

People who do well will be contacted through email within a week of acknowledgement of pull request submission.

Thanks and good luck!

## Instructions

1. Create a GraphQL endpoint to initiate ticket syncing
2. Implement consuming ticket API and saving tickets to the database
3. Get an API key for OMDB: http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx
4. Consume OMDB API to populate a movies collection for each of the tickets (you might get rate limited, so consume OMDB API key from environment variables)
5. You might have a few tickets without matching movies, adjust the logic to find those as well (you might still not be able to find 100% of them, but do your best)
6. Create a GraphQL endpoint with pagination to fetch tickets without matching movies
7. Extend existing `TicketResolver.listTickets` to output movie information for each ticket
8. `TicketResolver.listTickets` method is highly unoptimized. Optimize it to the best of your abilities. You can modify any file that you think would improve the response time
9. Create effective unit tests for the functions you see fit
10. You might have a few tickets with `inventory` equaled to `-1`. This should never be the case. Figure out where this is happening & fix the bug
11. There is a query to fetch a ticket by its ID. However, it's not working. Figure out why & fix the bug
